      <Heading level={1}>Our Story: Crafting Sound, Inspiring Passion</Heading>
      <Paragraph color='gray'>
        Tonevia was born in 2010 from a shared passion for music and
        craftsmanship. In a small workshop in the heart of Jakarta, our
        founders—Andi Pratama and Kevin Santoso—set out to create musical
        instruments that would inspire creativity and passion for musicians at
        all levels. Both lifelong musicians, Andi and Kevin knew firsthand the
        struggle of finding high-quality instruments that were accessible,
        reliable, and beautifully crafted. With a team of skilled artisans and
        sound engineers, the first Tonevia guitar was built—a result of
        countless hours of research, testing, and refinement. Word of its
        remarkable tone and quality quickly spread, and soon musicians across
        Indonesia began seeking Tonevia instruments. Encouraged by this success,
        the company expanded its offerings, introducing pianos, drums, and
        violins that adhered to the same standards of excellence.

        By 2015, Tonevia had grown from a small workshop into a trusted name in
        the Indonesian music scene. We opened our first production facility to
        meet increasing demand while staying true to our core values:
        craftsmanship, precision, and innovation. Our team of artisans worked
        tirelessly to ensure every instrument we produced was more than just a
        tool—it was a partner in every musician’s journey. In 2018, Tonevia went
        global. With international collaborations and partnerships, our
        instruments began reaching musicians in Southeast Asia, Europe, and
        beyond. This milestone reinforced our belief that music transcends
        boundaries, and every artist deserves access to instruments that bring
        their creativity to life.

        At Tonevia, we also take pride in our company culture. As a team, we are
        bound by a shared purpose: to serve the musical community and celebrate
        the joy that music brings. Whether it’s through supporting local music
        education programs, collaborating with professional artists, or
        innovating new designs, we are committed to nurturing creativity in
        every form. Today, Tonevia stands as a trusted name among musicians,
        educators, and performers worldwide. From the soulful chords of a guitar
        to the resonating notes of a piano, our instruments are designed to
        inspire. As we look to the future, our mission remains clear: to craft
        instruments that not only produce exceptional sound but also tell
        stories, elevate performances, and connect musicians across the globe.
